# SwiftUI Animations – Course Practice Projects

This repository contains code I wrote while following along with the Udemy course **“SwiftUI Animations”**. The course includes a variety of small animation-based projects.

I’m using this repo to:
- Practice different kinds of SwiftUI animations
- Explore animation techniques like hue rotation, shape morphing, gradients, CAEmitter effects, matched geometry, and more
- Track my learning progress

Each folder inside the project corresponds to a different mini project from the course. These are mostly follow-along builds meant to reinforce the concepts.

These projects are not production apps, they are meant as animation demos for learning purposes.
